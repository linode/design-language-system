# Basic Style Dictionary

This example code is bare-bones to show you what this framework can do. If you have the style-dictionary module installed globally, you can `cd` into this directory and run:
```bash
style-dictionary build
```

You should see something like this output:
```
Copying starter files...

Source style dictionary starter files created!

Running `style-dictionary build` for the first time to generate build artifacts.


scss
✔︎  build/scss/_variables.scss

js
✔︎  build/js/variables.js
```

Good for you! You have now built your first style dictionary! Moving on, take a look at what we have built. This should have created a build directory and it should look like this:
```
├── README.md
├── config.json
├── tokens/
│   ├── color/
│       ├── base.json
│       ├── font.json
│   ├── size/
│       ├── font.json
├── build/
│   ├── scss/
│      ├── _variables.scss
│   ├── js/
│      ├── variables.js
```

If you open `config.json` you will see there are 5 platforms defined: scss, android, compose, ios, and ios-swift. Each platform has a transformGroup, buildPath, and files. The buildPath and files of the platform should match up to the files what were built. The files built should look like these:

**SCSS**
```scss
// _variables.scss
$color-base-gray-light: #cccccc;
$color-base-gray-medium: #999999;
$color-base-gray-dark: #111111;
$color-base-red: #ff0000;
$color-base-green: #00ff00;
$color-font-base: #ff0000;
$color-font-secondary: #00ff00;
$color-font-tertiary: #cccccc;
$size-font-small: 0.75rem;
$size-font-medium: 1rem;
$size-font-large: 2rem;
$size-font-base: 1rem;
```

**JS**
```js
// variables.js
export const colorBaseGrayLight = "#cccccc";
export const colorBaseGrayMedium = "#999999";
export const colorBaseGrayDark = "#111111";
export const colorBaseRed = "#ff0000";
export const colorBaseGreen = "#00ff00";
export const colorFontBase = "#ff0000";
export const colorFontSecondary = "#00ff00";
export const colorFontTertiary = "#cccccc";
export const sizeFontSmall = "0.75rem";
export const sizeFontMedium = "1rem";
export const sizeFontLarge = "2rem";
export const sizeFontBase = "1rem";
```

Pretty nifty! This shows a few things happening:
1. The build system does a deep merge of all the token JSON files defined in the `source` attribute of `config.json`. This allows you to split up the token JSON files however you want. There are 2 JSON files with `color` as the top level key, but they get merged properly.
1. The build system resolves references to other design tokens. `{size.font.medium.value}` gets resolved properly.
1. The build system handles references to token values in other files as well as you can see in `tokens/color/font.json`.

Now let's make a change and see how that affects things. Open up `tokens/color/base.json` and change `"#111111"` to `"#000000"`. After you make that change, save the file and re-run the build command `style-dictionary build`. Open up the build files and take a look.

**Huzzah!**

Now go forth and create! Take a look at all the built-in [transforms](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/transforms?id=pre-defined-transforms) and [formats](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/formats?id=pre-defined-formats).
